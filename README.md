## üë©‚Äçüíº About Me

**AI Governance & Risk Consultant**  
MBA ‚Äì IT Management | Scrum-certified | IAPP AIGP (in progress)

I help small- and mid-sized businesses adopt AI responsibly, stay compliant, and keep humans in the loop.

> Jersey-born, Florida-based MBA who traded luxury-fashion marketing for AI governance. I bridge tech, policy, and storytelling so small businesses can innovate without fear. When I‚Äôm not building checklists or GPT agents, you‚Äôll find me brewing oat-milk caramel lattes or producing award-winning podcasts.
